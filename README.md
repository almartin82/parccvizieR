# parccvizieR:
### an R package that assists with analysis, visualization, and reporting for PARCC data

## Development Note:
The PARCC consortium is [no more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARCC), and no students take the PARCC.  Consequently, there's no need for tools for working with this data!  This repository is now read-only and archived.

# why parccvizieR?
States across the country have adopted the Common Core, and are using assessment consortia to help evaluate progress against these new standards.

One constortium is the [PARCC](http://www.parcconline.org).  Schools and districts are starting to get their data back from the first round of PARCC assessments.  Given that every district will get a standardized data file, why not write tooling collaboratively, and benefit from each other's work?

We have a sister package, [mapvizieR](github.com/almartin82/mapvizieR), where similar work happens for NWEA data.

# what's inside?
parccvizieR is written in R, an open-source statistical programming language.
